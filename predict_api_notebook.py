Campaign Prediction API - Jupyter Notebook Version

This file makes predictions for social media campaigns using a trained AI model.
It's optimized for running in Jupyter Notebook with clear cell divisions and
extensive comments to help non-technical users understand how it works.

=============================================================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (IN SIMPLE TERMS):
=============================================================================
Think of this as a "crystal ball" for marketing campaigns. You tell it:
  - How much money you want to spend ($10,000)
  - Which platform (TikTok, Instagram, or Meta/Facebook)
  - What type of campaign (Flood The Feed, Bau, or Mm)
  - What content type (Influencer, Paid Ads, or Owned content)

And it predicts:
  - How many IMPRESSIONS (people who will see your ad)
  - How much ENGAGEMENT (likes, shares, comments, saves)
  - ENGAGEMENT RATE (what % of viewers will interact)
  - Cost metrics (CPM, cost per engagement)

=============================================================================
HOW TO USE IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK:
=============================================================================
1. Convert this file to a notebook:
   - In Jupyter: File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Notebook
   - Copy each CELL block into a separate cell

2. OR use jupytext to convert automatically:
   pip install jupytext
   jupytext --to notebook predict_api_notebook.py

3. Run cells in order (CELL 1, CELL 2, CELL 3, etc.)

=============================================================================
BUSINESS CONTEXT:
=============================================================================
This prediction system helps marketing teams answer questions like:
  - "If I spend $50,000 on TikTok influencers, how many people will see it?"
  - "Should I invest in Instagram paid ads or Meta influencer content?"
  - "What's my expected engagement rate for this campaign?"

The AI model has been trained on 1,000 past campaigns and can predict
performance BEFORE you launch, saving you from wasting money on ineffective
campaigns.

# =============================================================================
#  What this cell does:
#   - Imports Python libraries needed for predictions
#   - These are like "toolboxes" that provide ready-made functions

#   - json: Handles data in JSON format (like structured text)
#   - joblib: Loads the saved AI model from disk
#   - numpy: Does math operations on numbers and arrays

# =============================================================================
#  What this cell does:
#   - Creates special types of errors for different problems
#   - Helps us identify exactly what went wrong if something fails
#
#  Why this matters:
#   - If the model file is missing, we get a "ModelPredictionError"
#   - If you enter invalid data (like negative budget), we get a "ValidationError"
#   - This makes debugging much easier than generic "Error" messages
#
# ‚è±  Run time: <1 second
#  Expected output: No output (just defines error types)

        #   1. Converts text to numbers (Platform "TikTok" ‚Üí [0, 1, 0])
        #   2. Scales numbers to a standard range

        # Mathematical note:

        #   - Real impressions = exp(12.5) - 1 = 267,114
